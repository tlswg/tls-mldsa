1.  Introduction

   ML-DSA is a post-quantum module-lattice based digital signature
   algorothm standardised by NIST in [FIPS204].

   This memo specifies how ML-DSA can be negotiated for authentication
   in TLS 1.3 via the signature_algorithms and signature_algorithms_cert
   extensions.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  ML-DSA SignatureScheme values

   As defined in [RFC8446], the SignatureScheme namespace is used for
   the negotiation of signature scheme for authentication via the
   signature_algorithms and signature_algorithms_cert extensions.  This
   document adds three new SignatureScheme values for the three ML-DSA
   parameter sets from [FIPS204] as follows.

     +=================+===========+=================================+
     | SignatureScheme | FIPS 204  | Certificate AlgorithmIdentifier |
     +=================+===========+=================================+
     | mldsa44(0x0904) | ML-DSA-44 | id-ML-DSA-44                    |
     +-----------------+-----------+---------------------------------+
     | mldsa65(0x0905) | ML-DSA-65 | id-ML-DSA-64                    |
     +-----------------+-----------+---------------------------------+
     | mldsa87(0x0906) | ML-DSA-87 | id-ML-DSA-87                    |
     +-----------------+-----------+---------------------------------+

                    Table 1: SignatureSchemes for ML-DSA

   Note that these are different from the HashML-DSA pre-hashed variants
   defined in Section 5.4 of [FIPS204].

3.1.  Certificate chain

   For the purpose of signalling support for signatures on certificates
   as per Section 4.2.4 of [RFC8446], these values indicate support for
   signing using the given AlgorithmIdentifier shown in Table 1 as
   defined in [MLDSACERTS].

3.2.  Handshake signature

   When one of those SignatureScheme values is used in a
   CertificateVerify message, then the signature MUST be computed and
   verified as specified in Section 4.4.3 of [RFC8446], and the
   corresponding end-entity certificate MUST use the corresponding
   AlgorithmIdentifier from Table 1.

   The context parameter defined in [FIPS204] Algorithm 2 and 3 MUST be
   the empty string.

3.3.  TLS 1.2

   The schemes defined in this document MUST NOT be used in TLS 1.2
   [RFC5246].  A peer that receives ServerKeyExchange or
   CertificateVerify message in a TLS 1.2 connection with schemes
   defined in this document MUST abort the connection with an
   illegal_parameter alert.

4.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests new entries to the TLS SignatureScheme
   registry, according to the procedures in Section 6 of [TLSIANA].

     +=================+=============+=============+================+
     | Value           | Description | Recommended | Reference      |
     +=================+=============+=============+================+
     | 0x0904 (please) | mldsa44     | N           | This document. |
     +-----------------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
     | 0x0905 (please) | mldsa65     | N           | This document. |
     +-----------------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
     | 0x0906 (please) | mldsa87     | N           | This document. |
     +-----------------+-------------+-------------+----------------+
